## About ArtConnect

_Created in seven hours for WolfHacks 2024 by Siddh Patel, Brian Zhang, Dravid Singh, and Liam West._

In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, we find ourselves surrounded by marvels of innovation that promise to make our lives easier, more efficient, and undoubtedly more connected. Yet, amidst the sea of likes, shares, and retweets, a quiet epidemic of loneliness has taken root, leaving many feeling isolated despite being constantly surrounded by virtual connections.

It is in this spirit that we propose to reclaim what it means to be truly connected. To harness the power of technology not to further isolate ourselves, but to foster genuine human connections and revitalize our communities. Starting with Brampton, we aim to reignite the flame of real human interaction, to create spaces where art, emotion, and community intertwine, bringing people together in ways that transcend the limitations of the digital world.

Join us in our mission to bridge the gap between technology and humanity, to rediscover the beauty of genuine connection, and to build a future where art, community, and humanity thrive hand in hand.
